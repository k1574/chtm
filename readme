# chtm

C HTM preprocessor for HTML with more C-like syntax.
Closer to CSS and so on. Made just for me since I hate closing tags.
May be and should be prepreprocessed with pp.

## Example

	<!doctype html>
	<html>{
		<head>{
			<meta charset="utf-8">
			<title>{Hello, <bold>{CML}!}
		}
		<body>{
			<strong>{Hello}, <i>{CML}!
		}
	}

will output into:

	<!doctype html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<meta charset="utf-8">
			<title>Hello, <bold>CML</bold>!</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<strong>Hello</strong>, <i>CML</i>!
		</body>
	</html>

## Important

not
	<tag> {something}
But
	<tag>{something}
Because first will be taken as singleton tag.
